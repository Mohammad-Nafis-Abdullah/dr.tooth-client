        "details": "Cavities are all too common and all too easy to get. For most cavities, a filling is the recommended answer. Acids in food and inside your body can easily break down tooth enamel if overexposed. It usually takes about an hour to finish up, and then it's good as new! You might feel pressure while they're working, but it shouldn't be painful.",

        "details": "This is one that most people dread, and for fair reasons. Root canals are usually preceded by some pretty awful tooth pain. A root canal means the tissue inside or under your tooth is infected and inflamed. To get rid of the pain, the dentist needs to deaden the nerve and remove the tissue. Sometimes you may need to take an antibiotic before the procedure.",

        "details": "This is by far the most common reason people visit the dentist. Many dentists recommend a cleaning every six months, and some recommend once a year. Either way, it's a very important part of oral health. Your own toothbrush will never be as efficient as the tools a dentist uses to clean your teeth.",
